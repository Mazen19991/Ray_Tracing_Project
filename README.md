# Ray_Tracing_Project
## Ray Tracing Final Project using C++  and windows Desktop wizard on Visual Studio

I undertook a ray tracing project that encompassed a diverse range of geometric shapes including spheres, planes, cylinders, cones, and triangles, alongside the incorporation of lighting sources. Within the project, I formulated fundamental functions, including constructors for Vector3 objects, operator overloads for arithmetic operations, indexing mechanisms, random vector generation, and cross product calculations. These functions played a pivotal role in enabling the creation of a dynamic scene where each object possessed unique attributes such as position, color, reflectivity, and refractive index. These attributes were stored within arrays tailored for each shape type. Employing the ray tracing algorithm, I meticulously calculated the colors of individual pixels by tracing rays originating from the camera, traversing through pixels, and interacting with scene objects. This algorithm featured functions dedicated to determining ray-object intersections, reflecting light, and handling refractions. The program also featured the 'Trace Ray' function, which adeptly traced rays throughout the scene, deriving the color of the first object encountered based on intricate lighting interactions. The main function, aptly named 'WinMain', was the entry point of the program. This function managed essential tasks such as setting up the window class, creating and displaying the program window, and overseeing message processing within a loop.
