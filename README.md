# Ray_Tracing_Project
## Ray Tracing Final Project using C++  and windows Desktop wizard on Visual Studio
Ray tracing is a sophisticated computer graphics technique that simulates light's behavior in virtual scenes to create photorealistic images. It involves defining
scene elements, such as objects, materials, lights, and cameras. Rendered by tracing rays of light from the camera to objects and lights, the technique calculates
how light interacts with materials. Reflected and refracted rays contribute to the realism, forming the image by iteratively interacting with scene elements.
While producing lifelike results, ray tracing demands significant computational power due to its complexity.
